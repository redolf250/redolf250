I have contributed significantly to software development, enhancing data collection, labor information systems, and application usability. I developed and integrated web crawlers, improving data retrieval efficiency. Additionally, I played a key role in the Ghana Labor Ministry Information System (GLMIS), a World Bank-funded project, delivering new features and optimizing system performance. I contributed to the web version of the Labor Inspection (LIPW) application, enhancing accessibility and usability. As a manual tester for GLMIS, I ensured feature reliability through meticulous testing. I collaborated with developers, testers, and stakeholders to drive project success. I also developed a notification service and an applicant document viewing system for Christian Service University (CSUC), streamlining communication and document management. My ability to adapt, problem-solve, and improve system efficiency has been crucial in delivering high-quality software solutions across multiple domains.
